# System Architecture & Design  

## Overview  
The application follows a **microservices-based architecture** with independent modules for API, database, and UI.

## Architecture Diagram  

## Microservices Structure  
| Service | Technology |
|---------|------------|
| Frontend | React.js |
| Backend | Spring Boot |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Authentication | JWT & OAuth2 |

## Design Principles  
✅ **Modularity:** Each service operates independently.  
✅ **Scalability:** Supports load balancing & microservices.  
✅ **Security:** Uses OAuth2 authentication.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add caching for performance.  
- Implement GraphQL for efficient data fetching.
